# |                 Simple /Hub Skript             |
# |               By ArX Studios Ã— gaganalk        |
# +================================================|=+
# | This Skript redirects players to the Hub       |
# | server using the command "joinq hub".          |
# |                                                |
# |  If you're using any command hider plugins     |
# | like CommandWhitelist or PL-Hide, make sure    |
# | to whitelist the following commands:           |
# |        /hub, /lobby, /server                   |
# |                                                |
# |  You can change "joinq hub" to your own        |
# | plugin's server join command, e.g:             |
# |    "server hub" for Bungee setups.             |
